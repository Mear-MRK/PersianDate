# Persian Calendar
This repository contains modules related to the Persian (Solar Hijri/Jalali) calendar (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_Hijri_calendar).

One of the most notable modules is `persian_date`, which includes:
  - The `PersianDate` class, which represents a date in the Persian calendar.
  - The `gregorian_date` property of the `PersianDate` class, which provides the equivalent date in the Gregorian calendar.
  - The `from_gregorian_date` function, which returns the Persian date equivalent of a given Gregorian date.
  - The `from_datetime_date` function, which returns the Persian date equivalent of a `datetime.date` object.
